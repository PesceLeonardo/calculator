## What this project has taught me

This project, recommended (and required in their course) by **The Odin Project**,
taught me how to be precise.

The first version of this calculator was full of bugs and imprecisions, because when coding it I had simply focused on making it work, be it well or not. I didn't have a starting plan, or a vision. My program had *no structure nor consistency*.

When it was time to add more features, I realized this couldn't work, so
I basically started from scratch, I defined an idea, a structure, and only THEN
did I code it.

This was much easier.

This project has taught me the importance of *structure and rigor* in programming,
the importance of having a good handle on *problem solving and logic*, and the importance
of *defining a logic before getting to code*.
